# SSADisplayImages

A program to investigate reading a folder full of images, managing a list of the file names
and then scrolling through the list and displaying the images.

A ScrollBar was considered, but the control of the timing to display a flurry of images as
the bar is moved quickly seems like an unneeded complexity The scroll bar will be read only
and will display the position in the list of images, but movement will be buttons. Start,Back 10,
Back 1, Forward 1, Forward 10, End.

To begin, the Destination path will be used, with the folder suffix, the file prefix and the current date to
find a folder in the destination folder tree to find images that match the current "Game Pair".

This program follows the pattern of discovery and coding of parts of the final problem as distinct parts and 
gradually building up the final program.
